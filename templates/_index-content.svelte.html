        <p>With Sen. Amy Klobuchar announcing her entry into a crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field this week, she joins the ranks of a other Minnesotans who have competed in America's biggest political contest.</p>

        <p>Past presidential candidates from Minnesota haven't fared very well, with only one ever emerging from the primaries with the nomination. While Minnesota historically boasts two Vice Presidents, its record at helping get its own into the Oval Office is a less impressive 0-5.</p>

        <p>Klobuchar is a wildly popular senator in Minnesota, as evidenced by her crushing election victories, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/how-amy-klobuchar-fared-in-trump-country/498035261/">including 2018's 60 percent vote share</a>. How her local popularity translates to the national stage remains to be seen.</p>

        <p>Here's how the past presidential candidacies of Minnesota's politicians have performed throughout time:</p>

        <div class="yearTag">1968 Democratic Primary</div>
        <p>Having represented Minnesota in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, Eugene McCarthy also ran for president five different times. McCarthy's most famous campaign was his attempt to primary President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 on an anti-Vietnam War platform.</p>
        <p>The primary was thrown into chaos when Johnson ultimately declined to seek a second term, pitting McCarthy against fellow Minnesotan and U.S. Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, who won the nomination, despite McCarthy faring well in prior state contests.</p>
        <p>McCarthy ran for president again in 1972 and 1992 as a Democrat, and as an independent in 1976 and 1998. He didn't get very far any of those races.</p>

        <p>Minnesota has famously been one of the most reliably Democratic states in the union during presidential election years, with the state only voting for Republicans <a href="http://www.startribune.com/just-how-close-is-minnesota-to-becoming-a-swing-state/393152021/">three times in its whole history</a>.

        <p>Minnesota stuck with its long history of Democratic voting and was the only state (plus Washington D.C.) to vote for Mondale, who suffered a crushing loss in Ronald Reagan's reelection landslide.</p>

        <p>Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty declared his candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination in 2011, but dropped out less than three months later after finishing third in the Ames Straw Poll.</p>
        <p>Former Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachmann <a href="http://m.startribune.com/bachmann-wins-ames-straw-poll/127657618/">won that same straw poll with a quarter of the votes</a>.

        <p>Both Bachmann and Pawlenty eventually endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination, which he won. Romney, of course, lost to President Barack Obama who went on to a second term.</p>
