        <p>With Minnesota's Sen. Amy Klobuchar announcing her entry into a crowded 2020 Democratic presidential field this week, it's worth noting she's not the only Minnesotan to run for President of the United States.</p>

        <p>Minnesota has famously been one of the most reliably Democratic states in the union during presidential election years, with the state only voting for Republicans three times in its whole history.</p>

        <p>When Minnesota's own are on the ticket, as with many home states, it has loyally voted for the hometown candidate over the decades. But those candidates have never nationally fared well. While Minnesota boasts two Vice Presidents in U.S. history, its record at helping get its own into the Oval Office is a less impressive 0-4.</p>

        <p>Here's how past Minnesota candidates, both those who fizzled in the primaries and those who won the nomination, fared throughout time.</p>
